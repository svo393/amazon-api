Acer customer service was not helpful. They suggested troubleshooting solutions that I completed but were pointless. Their customer service staff also clearly did not communicate well with one another. On a subsequent call it appeared that the notes provided by the previous CSR were inadequate to communicate the steps we already took. They are unwilling to provide a positive outcome..

                content: `Wow. This is a great computer. Any complaints made about the C24-865 have been resoundingly addressed here.

              Notable features:
              -The keyboard USB dongle is in the bottom edge of the monitor. This is a great improvement, as often they plug into the back causing bad/choppy keyboard response.
              -The mouse is already plugged in and ready to go.
              -The SD reader, audio jack, and keyboard dongle are all on the bottom edge. Easy access!
              -You can easily add a second/dual monitor.
              -This monitor is nice and bright with a great, wide viewing angle.
              -It does have a disc drive, which is becoming rare these days.
              -Because it has a solid state drive, it reboots ridiculously fast.
              -It has a dual mic, and the sound quality of the speakers is fantastic.
              -Alexa works very well with it.
              -The webcan quality is better.
              -We did plug our Firestick into the HDMI port (oh yeah, it has one) and it works. You can use this like a TV if you wanted to.
              -It‚Äôs convenient. Plug in the power cord and you‚Äôre ready to go.

              My husband is in IT and works with this stuff every day. He loves this computer. We have installed it in a public area and created accounts for everyone. The whole family uses it, and the kids are getting a jump on back to school assignments using this. It‚Äôs amazing!`,

                title: 'A genuine review.',
                content: `My deeply personal understanding tells me that this is how it works: Acer sells limited amount of new AIOs aspire z for $690, "electronics" company workers buy those out and sells them to their company (always a different one). AIOs become used and later are sold for $969. My only problem with that is that the ratings and five stars, and all the positive comments tag along the item since when Acer releases it. Happy customers from Acer leave excellent grades and positive comments, unhappy customers of Something Electronics leave different comments. First category of customers outnumbers the second one, tricking people like myself into thinking that the reseller is legit.
              So this is my review of my purchase. On top of overpaying $300 for it, mine turned out to be damaged as well.
              In two words: Don't buy from this "storefront," wait until Acer is the seller again.

              I hope this helps.
              P.S. When Acer sells it, Amazon is the distributor and if you are a prime member your 2-day delivery is free. When reseller sells it, if you don't want to wait a month while it arrives through the cheapest option the reseller chooses, the 2-day delivery option is another $100+`,

                title: 'Incredibly Easy to Multi-task, Visually Appealing, and Great Form Factor',
                content: `Overall:
              The screen is phenomenal and easily used as a small TV or high-quality office computer. What is cool about this all-in-one computer is that the monitor actually feels about the same weight and size as a flat-screen monitor from about 5-7 years ago. Yet it is a full computer, which is just amazing. The quality display really makes this a nice product from a graphics perspective. That said, while it has an excellent screen for watching streaming shows, it‚Äôs really not a gaming computer as it has an integrated video card and would not be appropriate for high-end gaming. It is awesome if you have wanted to multi-task and stream shows, videos, etc all while performing basic office tasks for work which this computer is really well suited for. Checking emails on this screen is unbelievably convenient because of the large screen and easy viewing of a large number of emails.

              The Setup: There is some setup with the display screen. You will need to assemble the stand which is just a matter of screwing together a few parts and it‚Äôs fairly easy. Be sure to uncork the plastic from the base and actually screw the screen in. Otherwise, it will literally tilt off of the base and fall. I have provided a picture of how easy it is once it is understood. The keyboard and mouse work without setup and are fully wireless. They are battery-powered though and that isn‚Äôt the best.

              Specs: The performance for most basic applications except those needing a high-end graphics card is fantastic. I primarily use for Microsoft Office, Adobe, Internet browsing, and streaming. I‚Äôve had no issues and it can simultaneously run a number of programs with 12 GB memory with ease. Other nice features include inbuilt wifi (no Ethernet cord needed) and connections (HDMI) for either a second monitor or output to a larger TV. (note that there is one HDMI in and one HDMI out).
              The 512 GB SSD is great for basic storage especially of almost any set of software (which is really nice to have an SSD for faster run speeds), but an external hard drive would be needed for more expansive storage as this does not have add-on ports since there is no tower. The computer itself runs quiet and has not overheated even under heavy use. Video and sound quality have been qualitatively fantastic in my tests so far and I have no complaints.
              I am really impressed! This computer multi-tasks well and is very user-friendly. Cortana can guide your way through windows with this visually appealing and easy to use computer. Cortana may also be used with Alexa. I think this is an excellent choice and that you will be pleased.`,

Bought two of these for my small office in a strip mall and they work perfectly for the slim size and overall performance (it will take more than half a day to get to the current Windows 10 release 1903, though with all the updates). Can\'t believe these were being sold for $199 as "like new" because they look brand new and the plastic was still on both keyboards and mice (and this exact model sells at Wal-Mart for $399!). These literally look brand new. For $400 I have outfitted my office with all the PC power needed with a terabyte of disk space and access to OneDrive that syncs with my iPhone. Bargain city and fast shipping by the seller! ',

                content: `I got this computer on May 11, 2020, after ordering on May 3, 2020. I hesitated because of all of the reviews about the speed and the noise, slow processor, and the click sound from the keyboard. Right out the box, I did one thing that I believe will help everyone. Connect directly to the WiFi via ethernet cable. There is speed you just have to connect properly. My husband bought this for me as a birthday present. I have always used a Surface and did not want to pay a whopping $1300 for a Surface Desktop. Let me admit I am getting older and the small screen of the Surface is not good but also who needs a $1300 computer? Not me. Yes, the fan is loud but so is my daily life since COVID-19. I just went into the Microsoft store and downloaded all of my apps and decided which ones were necessary and which were not. I don't mind the clicking of the keyboard keys. It's better than PlayStation all day. As always I will keep the boxes for 30 days to make sure I have them if I have to send it back. But so far out the box, it is a good buy. I even went back to Amazon to see how much it would cost to get another one for my sister but she likes the HP laptop and the price of this one has almost tripled. Which brings me to the cost issue with Amazon. They are letting other sellers sell it for triple the price. That is just crazy. I will update my review with pictures and with any issues in 30 days. It is not a touch screen, it comes with enough memory and I have a 1 Tb external drive, it comes with the keyboard, it comes with Office for Home I just downloaded my Office 365 that I got from school. But for now, this is just what I needed to work from home and organize daily life.
                Update 1 week WOW!!!!!!
                I have had no issues with this computer, No fan noise, Not slow, No multiple tab issues with the internet. As you can see from the picture. I set it up on my desk, using the keyboard drawer. I am recovering from major rotator cuff surgery in the middle of this Covid-19. Working from home could not use my surface comfortably. Thank you Honey, this is just what this old girl needed to work from home and be comfortable. No more squinting, no more resting my bad arm uncomfortably. It connected wirelessly to my printer. It is connected directly to my high speed internet via cable and BAM!!!!!!! Lighting fast. I will continue use and update but I really don't understand the complaints.
                Update 5/28/2020.....I have added pictures of my set up as well as the back of the computer with connections. I have it connected directly to the internet via ethernet cable and it is fast. I also hooked up my speakers with my microphone it plays my music much louder(Amazon Music) and my Microsoft teams meeting are better as well. I have nothing bad to say yet and I will continue to update till I have had it 60 days.
                Update June 6,2020. WOW STILL!!
                Had my first team meeting with work and everyone had computer issues except me. They kept dropping the meeting and stayed on through the whole meeting. I am working for a large Healthcare system and this is just what I needed the screen is perfect size and I still don't mind the keyboard sound and the fan noise is not there at all. I have one wish..... that you could add an additional monitor (that is how I work in the office). Otherwise this is my final review up date. Feel free to contact me and ask questions I will be happy to respond.
                Sept 4, 2020...WOW!!! Still without question the desktop of my dreams. I have been working from home since March 15, 2020 and this computer is a workhorse. Thank you Honey. It is the best computer and Birthday gift ever. Still connected via ethernet cable it is just AMAZING!!!!!!!! `,

                content: 'I have been using this all-in-one computer for a few days now. It arrived perfectly in the box and setup was extremely easy. The computer itself is beautifully designed and stylish and the white color fits in very well. The screen is sleek and thin. The keyboard is wired and the keys are clunky and loud. I\'ll be purchasing a wireless soft/quiet key keyboard since I don\'t want everyone in the room hearing when I\'m typing. The downside to this computer is it is slow even for basic tasks. I\'m impatient and expect computers now to be responsive and not lag when multi-tasking. This computer does not multitask well even after uninstalling unnecessary programs. I have to End Task on several things that run in the background to help speed up the computer. It\'s a huge annoyance since even basic tasks like opening the email app and Google Chrome lag and going between apps there is a lag and programs are slow to open. If you\'re used to responsive computers, this one will test your patience, literally. If you\'re one who isn\'t impatient and doesn\'t mind waiting 30 seconds to a minute for things to open and run then this is a great computer that meets the basic needs. I love the design and how nicely it blends in with my home decor and doesn\'t stand out at all and isn\'t obtrusive and fits very nicely on my desk.',

Please refer to "USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning" for more details.
                Instant Pot can be used for boiling-water canning. However, Instant Pot has not been tested for food safety in pressure canning by USDA. Due to the fact that programs in Instant Pot IP-CSG, IP-LUX and IP-DUO series are regulated by a pressure sensor instead of a thermometer, the elevation of your location may affect the actual cooking temperature. For now, we wouldn't recommend using Instant Pot for pressure canning purpose. Please note this correction to our early inaccurate information.`

                content: `ABSOLUTELY NOT. It does not reach high enough pressure for it to be safe to follow the USDA tested recommendations for pressure canning. If you want to can, buy a REAL pressure canner. I've been canning for 56 years as of 2019. I won't even can with a boiling water bath anymore and haven't for years. Tomatoes were the only thing I ever canned that way and the vast majority of modern breeds are not naturally acidic enough for it to be safe. IMNSHO tomatoes were the ONLY thing that was ever safe to put in a boiling water bath. PRESSURE CANNERS MADE FOR THE PURPOSE ONLY.

                I used to seal jelly jars with a layer of paraffin wax and I don't do THAT anymore either.

                Be safe and Do It Right. This is a great kitchen tool for cooking. DO NOT EVEN THINK about trying to can in it. It is WAY too small for one thing, and it isn't safe (the more important reason NOT TO DO IT) for another.`

                content: `I bought both the 3 qt. and 6 qt. "Smart Pots" to try... and the 3 qt. is the clear winner!!! I come from a long line of pressure cooking women... that is how I came to own both 6 qt. and 8 qt. traditional stainless steel pressure cookers. I tend to use my 3 qt. Mini Smart Pot a LOT... and store it in a place where it's handy to grab (often). I like the mini b/c it is small and I like the convenience of the timer for most of the day-to-day things I do. And I agree with what everybody else here already stated... I also found the overall size of the 6 qt. Smart Pot TOO BIG‚Ä¶ so I sold my 6 quart Smart Pot.

                When I need to cook something in larger portions, I always use my 8 qt. traditional pressure cooker (which isn't that often b/c I usually freeze the extra food into future mini-meals). A traditional pressure cooker PRESSURE COOKS THE SAME as a "Smart Pot" (minus the "timer"), but takes up a LOT LESS STORAGE SPACE -- that why I kept my 8 qt. traditional stainless steel pressure cooker. Yes, it is a pretty darn big pot, but it uses so little storage space (as compared to the larger "Smart Pots"). I also kept my 6 qt. traditional pressure cooker too, simply b/c it nests (stores) nicely inside my 8 qt. pot and does not take up any extra space.

                I should also mention that I only use my 3 qt. Smart Pot Mini Duo for pressure cooking. I was really excited about the idea that I could use one appliance for both pressuring cooking AND slow cooking. THAT is the primary reason why I tried the Smart Pot in the first place. However, I was really disappointed with the Smart Pot slow cooker feature, which does not do as good a job as a traditional slow cooker (b/c the Smart Pot has a small base and is tall vs. the slow cooker which has a very wide base/cooking surface).

                What do I cook in my Smart Pot 3 qt. mini? I frequently cook a 4 lb. whole chicken (or more, if the chicken is cut up), make bone broth, rice or hard boiled eggs. Otherwise, I make anything that you would make with the larger models‚Ä¶ I just cut the ingredient list down to fit my smaller machine. Note ‚Äì personally, I think a traditional rice cooker, hands down makes better rice than a Smart Pot, but when making rice, just for me, I like the convenience of the Smart Pot. However, if I were making rice for company, I definitely use my rice cooker.

                I LOVE my Smart Pot 3 qt. mini ‚Äì it is small and convenient to use. But the truth about this appliance is (as is also true for ANY size Smart Pot) that, if you are only going to use the pressure cooker feature (which is all I use), the only real difference in function vs. a traditional pressure cooker is ‚Äúthe timer‚Äù. And that is, I gotta admit, a nice feature. And that is also why I love my Mini‚Ä¶ but it is not enough of a benefit for me to trade-off much needed kitchen space for any of the larger 6 or 8 qt. Smart Pot models which take up a BIGGER amount of space. It‚Äôs a tradeoff. And that is also why I am super happy with my Smart Pot 3 qt. Mini and use a traditional 8 qt. pressure cooker when I need to cook MORE.

                I highly recommend the following book whether you are considering purchasing a multicooker or even if you already have one and just want to understand it better: Multicooker Perfection: Cook it Fast or Cook it Slow ‚Äì You Decide by America‚Äôs Test Kitchen (Cooks Illustrated). The book was well organized and a simple read, yet loaded with detailed testing of different Multicooker models, as well as the ‚Äúpros and cons‚Äù of each multicooker feature, along with the even more important ‚Äúhow and why‚Äù explanation of their opinion. I got this book at my library, but found it to be so fundamentally valuable that I still went out and bought a copy to own.`

ItThe Instant Pot still works very well for cooking rice, though - you will have to find out about time and rice to water ratio yourself, because not everybody likes his rice the same way. For measuring rice and water use the small plastic cup that comes with the IP (same type that comes with rice cookers). With white rice you can use the "rice" setting, with all types of brown rice use the "pressure cook" setting. I like my rice moist and soft so I use 1 cup of rice to two cups of water for brown rice and cook for 22 min.'

                content: `I was loving my instant pot, bragging to all about it. Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped. Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all. It wasn't really difficult to use.

                Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response!

                Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days....

                My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason. It should be posted though people should know what kind of company this is...`,

                    However, I recently noticed the Air Fryer is not compatible with the Instant Pot MAX. I sent them 2 messages just asking why are they not compatible. It's not like I'm even planning to return the Air Fryer. It's working great with our MAX. But I want to know why they are not compatible. It could be a fire issue, it could be it causes one or the other to fail an early life, I don't know. But I don't want to burn our house down.

                    A simple response from the customer service as to why they are not compatible is all I need. If it's a fire issue we'll quit using them together. If it is a "early failure" by using them together then we'll decide if it's worth it.

                    The products are great but they need to do something about the customer service. If & when they respond they'll probably use the Corona Virus as the excuse. My wife & I both work for engineering companies & we are responding to customer questions from home every day. Go figure why Instant Pot can't do the same.`

The inner pot is 6.5" deep (which isn't much difference from a smaller unit) however it is 11" wide on the interior and 12" across on the exterior lip of the stainless pot. Without the lid on the unit it around 10.5" tall, and with the lid it is somewhere between 13-14".

                In regards to features it has plenty, however I was a bit sad it doesn't have the egg feature. But given how many times I have used the function on my smaller Instant Pot, I know it is just 5 minutes high pressure and 5 minutes until I release the pressure.

                I love the new pressure valve. Now I don't have to turn it and make sure it is set properly for the pressure to build. The whole unit is great BUT, the trivet! Seriously the trivet is the same size that comes with the 6qt and comes nowhere close to covering the bottom of the unit. They clearly should have designed a trivet to fit this very large unit. I'm docking one star for that because I find it to be annoying.

I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings.

                I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours.

                I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving.

                I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack.

                Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on.

                I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!`,

                content: `We're using this pot to cook for two and it does a great job, save for one problem--the little float valve in the lid does not pop up on its own.

                In order to get the float valve to pop up, I have to tap on it or grab the lid and press down on it once enough pressure has been built up inside the pot.

                I can't tell if this is a design flaw or a fault of the valve--it's a pretty basic little thing and unless the valve is catching on a rough bore in the lid or something, I don't see why it won't raise up on its own. Once I get it to pop up, the unit works like a charm.

                I was hoping it was user error, but after four months of using the pot almost weekly and experimenting with advice from online, I'm pretty sure this isn't right. Maybe I should contact the manufacturer, because right now, I have to watch the pot to ensure it will build pressure.`,

                For frame of reference (and to learn from my experiences) here's what you'll probably care about. When you buy a 4 quart slow cooker, that's good for about a 4 pound roast. You could maybe fit a 4.5 pounder in there, but it'll be mighty snug and may not work as well as you'd like. I have kids with hollow legs, and think I'll soon be looking for a 6 quart slow cooker. Also- if you're doing a roast, put it on the low heat and give it 8 hours. Yes, sure- you could use the higher heat and get the interior to 160F and eat it, but it won't be the same. Trust me on this. I've taken notes.

                As far as the cooker goes, I like it a lot- easy to clean, convenient size, and versatile. The only thing I'd ask Hamilton Beach to change is to add a power LED or something that will make it clear from across the room if it's on.`,

                I returned the first crock (because of the problems listed below) but was so in love with the size (large family here) that I decided to give a replacement another try. This one still has gaps in the lid. All I can imagine is that this will increase cooking times significantly! Also, there are pitting in the second crock (see photos). When I contacted Hamilton Beach about this problem, they informed me that it was a "normal" part of the process and that the crock would perform just fine. I have had many crocks over the years (mainly Crock Pot brand) and never have they had this pitting. Hamilton Beach refused to do anything about this pitting problem. Their customer service is pathetic! Unhappy to say the least! Please do NOT purchase this crockpot/slow cooker. You will be disappointed.
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                The lid does not fit the crock. On both ends, there is air space of approx 1/4" to 1/2" where the lid does not lie flat on the crock. Instructions say don't cook with lid locked but the air space unlocked will cause the cooking time to increase dramatically. Very poor quality! I'm going to return it.`,

                content: 'Sorry Kim, but you can\'t set this cooker to turn on later in the day. For the meals that I cook in this unit that\'s never been a problem--for example, a pot roast that requires a 6-hour cooking time on the low setting will still be perfect after 8 or 10 hours because there\'s simply no evaporation to allow the food to dry out. If you\'re making a casserole that only needs to "bake" for a couple hours, and you want to serve after an 8-hour workday, you\'ll need to use the timed feature on your regular oven. I\'m not aware of any slow cookers that have a delayed start feature for that very reason; they simply don\'t allow food to dry out. So as long as you cook your food for the minimum required time, extending the length of cooking time for hours, even, is never a problem. This slow cooker will automatically switch to the warm setting after the cook time that you programmed has elapsed, or the probe registers that the food is cooked. I\'ve used quite a few different slow cookers, and this one (and its\' smaller cousin) are by far my favorites. If you spent 10 times the amount of money, this would still be the best slow cooker of all, in my opinion.'

                title: 'It\'s not all that.',
                content: `I use my slow cooker all the time, so when it finally conked out, it was almost like losing a best friend. After many hours of research and reading reviews, I finally settled on this model due to the temp probe. Awesome idea, and that feature does work. However, there were a number of issues that had me packing this puppy up and shipping it back.

                1. Yes, the lid does smell like the food you cooked. I read that in the other reviews, and at first I'm like, so what? If I had a guest that was sniffing the lid, I'd politely escort them out the door and they'd be a guest no more, right? Well, I get it now. I keep my cooker in a cabinet, and when I opened the cabinet to take it out, the odor just wafted out. Yuck.
                2. I don't know if it's a defect or maybe it was operator error, but I couldn't change the temp during the cook. The first meal I cooked was a large batch of 15 bean soup with ham hocks. I started it on Hi with Hold Temp on and set to 180, as that's what the chart says is "Simmer". Okay. At 109 degrees my soup was boiling and I tried to turn it to Low and it wouldn't let me. So I had to cancel the cook and reprogram it. Really? (Glad I was home to catch it.) I set it to Low without Hold Temp, then the soup wasn't bubbling at all. Now I'm frustrated. Why oh why did my old cooker have to die??
                3. The backlit display turns off, and you can't really see the status of your cook. I was afraid to touch the dial for fear of cancelling it. It's a small matter, I know. But still, slow cooking should be a stress free experience.
                4. The glass lid would be awesome to peek at how your cook is going, if you could see through it. The condensation gets so bad you can't see through it. I even tried tapping on the lid to knock some of the moisture off, but it made little difference. Grrr...
                5. As you may be able to tell in the pics, the crock discolored after my second cook. I hand washed and dried both the lid and the crock, so I'm not sure why it became so cloudy.
                6. The metal hinges you use to lock down the lid for transport are pretty flimsy.

                Too many little things were enough to have me saying "sayonara" Hamilton Beach and "hello" Aicok.`,

                content: `This dress looked bit plain to be honest online. I had recently lost a good deal of weight and wasnt sure what size to get. I had a dress from when I was heavier that was a 14 that was now quite big. So I ordered 3 different dresses, a 12, and two size 10's all Calvin Klein, but different styles. This was my "safe" dress.
                I put this one on last, and instantly my husband who had really liked the first one was like, "that's the one." My friend said basically the same. It was so classy looking, the navy just enough to give it a pop of suprise, so it was more than just a plain little black dress. I wore it to a wedding, where I saw people who I hadn't seen in months. The dress highlighted my weight loss and I recieved so many compliments on that, and the dress, and those who disnt know me before complimented the dress itself.
                I paired it with nude heels and a nude purse and honestly I felt great. This is truly a beautiful dress. Excellent quality, simple but the color and sheer detail at the hem give it just enough to be special. I highly recommend it.`,

                content: 'My daughter decided she wanted to get this dress for Prom. I actually tried to talk her out of it- Prom is a big deal! I wanted to see her in a high quality dress. But she was determined, so we ordered it. It arrived quickly, and came just as described. The emerald color was stunning. She is not tall, about 5\'4", and with 2" heels the length was perfect. It was very wrinkly, but a steamer quickly took the wrinkles out. I wish she had done a better job of steaming it, there were a few left on the bottom of the dress that show up in this photo. The fit is loose and drapes. She did have one problem with the chest, it was cut way too low for her. She remedied this easily with some double sided tape and had no problems with it the entire night. Also, it did not look odd with the double sided tape. The only thing that really bothered me was that the tag is sewn into the leg slit, so when she walked or when it was breezy, the tag showed. It really is a very thin material. She took the tag out easily with some sewing scissors. Is it a cheap dress? Absolutely. But it was the look, color, and fit that she wanted. She did buy some silicone "nipple shields" but had no problems with these. This is probably not a dress you can wear a bra with unless you have a sticker bra. My daughter is very small so it wasn\'t a problem. This dress will show body flaws or underwear lines easily, so if there\'s something you\'re not comfortable with, just be aware of this. All things considered, it was a pretty great look on her. She was very happy with it and was super happy to save so much money. She looked and felt beautiful. I had my doubts but she was right!',

                The color is gorgeous and it‚Äôs not a cheap thin material that I expected. I got a blush color but it photographs in low light as a champagne so that‚Äôs fun.
                I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and it has a few inches past my feet so you can wear heels and it will still be long. I would even hem it but I like when it drags on the floor. So pretty.

The chest area seemed hopelessly baggy, no matter how many times I tried to tie and re-tie the strings. The slit was far too high and showed my underwear easily. The cut of the dress itself was a bit uneven. The material caught on literally everything and immediately started fuzzing / coming off from first contact with objects out of the bag it came in. I really wanted to like the dress and was hoping to wear it to a wedding, especially with the good reviews and how great everyone looked in it, but sadly it didn\'t seem to be the dress for me. ',

I originally ordered a medium but found it to be a little tight through the chest area so I ordered a large which fit much better (not tight and a little longer). I am 5‚Äô4 155lbs and a 32G. Dress is fairly see through, So I wore a slip under mine. Overall very happy with this purchase!',
